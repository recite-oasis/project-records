# Project records

This repository is intended for documents recording the history of the RECITE project, including meeting minutes.

## Meeting minutes

Minutes are the records of project meetings and a key part of the group’s historical record. They are useful for members 
who miss a meeting or as a reminder of decisions made and pending business in preparation for an upcoming meeting. 
They memorialize attendance and quorum, document key decisions and milestones, and may be needed when requesting support actions from OASIS staff.

To help meet OASIS’s principle of maximizing visibility into Open Project work, OASIS has minimal requirements for minutes so as to provide you 
with maximum flexibility:

- The minutes must be posted to the committee’s primary mailing list; and

- The minutes must record individual attendance at the meeting.

For suggested best practices for capturing minutes, including suggestions on how much detail to capture and an easy template to use, see [Best Practices for Meeting Minutes](http://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/TCHandbook/Best-practices-for-meeting-minutes-v1.0.html).
